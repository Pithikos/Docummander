## What is dis?
Just [try it out and find for youself](http://pithikos.github.io/docummander).

How this works is simply by putting together Jekyll and the Github infrastructure to provide
a platform to start documenting easily and fast.

The big points are these:

  * **Edit pages on the browser** - edit and add pages directly from the browser
  * **No boilerplate** - every page is simple markdown with nothing more
  * **Github technologies** - that means free and without learning curve
  * **Backup** - Since the documentation is a git project, if you make a mistake you can always go back


## Start documenting

You can make a new project to just hold your documentation or you
can use an already project to have its documentation on the side.

  1. Make a branch `gh-pages` in your project
  2. Copy the files from this project in there
  3. Go to <b>http://*username*.github.io/*repository*</b>

## Configuration

The only needed configuration are some variables in `_config` mostly to fix paths.
