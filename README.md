## What is dis?
Just [try it out](http://pithikos.github.io/docummander) and find for youself.

How this works is simply by putting together Jekyll and the Github infrastructure to provide
a platform to start documenting easily and fast.

The big points are these:

  * ** Edit pages on the browser** - edit and add pages directly from the browser
  * ** Markdown** - every page is simple markdown with zero boilterplate
  * ** Runs on Github pages ** - that means free and without learning curve
  * ** Backup ** - Since the documentation is a git project, if you make a mistake you can always go back


## Documenting an existing project

  1. Make a branch `gh-pages` in your project
  2. Copy the files from this project in there
  3. Go to <b>http://*username*.github.io/*repository*</b>

## Documenting as a stand-alone

Make a new project to hold your documentation and then do the steps as above.
