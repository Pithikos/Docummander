# How it works

Below you can read more on how everything is implemented.


## Title
The title is the single hash `#` of markdown. If you don't use that, then
your page will have no main title.


## Indexing
The first line of each .markdown file is used for indexing that specific file.
That means that accessing indexed['How it works'] will point to this page.
